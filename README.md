# 🔢 Partition Generator (Python)

This project implements a recursive algorithm to generate all unique partitions of a given set. Each partition represents a grouping of elements into disjoint non-empty subsets. This exercise was completed as part of BU METCS300 to demonstrate recursive thinking and deep copy control in nested structures.

## 📌 Features

- Recursively computes all valid partitions of a list
- Uses deep copy to prevent mutation of nested lists
- Outputs partitions in structured format
- Includes small test cases to verify correctness

## 🛠 Technologies

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuqilin77/Partition-Generator.git
   cd Partition-Generator
2. Run the partition program:
   python partition.py
3. Modify the a_list inside the code to test different inputs.
